# Dinosaur Mini Challenge

## lessons learned from this challenge

## 1. Give branches for different features specific names (ie. card-one or card-two)
## 2. If styling is off, wait until all features have been added. Then, create a new branch to fix styling and any other issues you're having (ie. footer/margins)
