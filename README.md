# Dinosaur Mini Challenge

## Description
Create a site for your favorite dinosaur. Write clean code - consistent spacing, appropriate tabbing, etc. Use git git branches, and github. You should have a fresh branch for each of the following features:
* As a user, when I go to your site I should see your favorite color set to the background, and I should see a footer with your name and date.
* As a user, when I go to your site I should see a card with a picture of you and a paragraph about you, and this card should take up half the width of the screen
* As a user, when I go to your site I should see a card with a picture of your favorite type of dinosaur and a paragraph of why its your favorite dinosaur, and this card should take up half the width of the screen
